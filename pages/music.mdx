I'm a **producer/composer/pianist**, currently releasing chiptune-inspired electronic music, digital fusion, and instrumental beats as **renzofrog**üê∏

Recently, I've

- showcased my [electroacoustic](https://soundcloud.com/renzomledesma/sets/electroacoustic) works at UIUC **Music from the Experimental Music Studios** concerts throughout 2022
- competed in several beat battles held by [The Five Points Bakery](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17901248447603543/), [Nola's Rock Bar Cypher Saturdays](https://www.instagram.com/p/CjLu6g-Ntcb), and helped host battles by [School of Music](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CkhcEWWInjv)
- collaboratively composed and produced the soundtrack for the short film [**Out of Time** (2021)](/out-of-time)
- composed and produced music for the Philippine Student Association at UIUC's cultural dancing group, **Barkada**, from 2020 to [2021](/fact)

I started learning music through piano lessons and began using music technology software early in schooling. I make lots of different types of music, beginning with electronic/EDM in my early years of learning music technology and recently branching into hip-hop, film, electroacoustic, and digital fusion music while keeping my piano roots.

Academically, I'm finishing my undergraduate degree in [Computer Science + Music at UIUC](https://music.illinois.edu/about-us/facilities/experimental-music-studios/facilities/), learning digital signal processing and audio programming to write fun, interesting audio software while teaching others about music technology. I'm also

- an active member of the [Experimental Music Studios](https://music.illinois.edu/about-us/facilities/experimental-music-studios/facilities/) (EMS) led by director [Professor Fieldsteel](https://www.elifieldsteel.com/)
- a course assistant for the Art of Beatmaking course sequence at UIUC taught by [ Professor Lamont Holden (TheLetterLBeats) ](https://www.instagram.com/theletterlbeats/?hl=en)
- a producer for [_HIDEOUT_](https://www.instagram.com/hideout.hhc/) (prev. Hip Hop Collective).

I made a new track everyday for 5 days from 8.9.2021 to 8.13.2021. They ended up becoming some of my favorite work for being influential to my musical direction and just plain fun to make and listen to.
