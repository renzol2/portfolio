## an overdue update

oops, it's been a while.

for the sake of getting some writing done, i'm going to word vomit a post right now. in lieu of maintaining this website or even making music, i've been doing the following things:

- learning languages (like, linguistic languages, not programming languages)
- finishing up old music projects from undergrad
- living life slowly, at my own pace
- crumbling mentally at the state of the world

i'm not going into too much detail into any of these - i'll save that for future blog posts. anyway, i am working on new music, and since you're reading this post, i've also managed to revive my motivation to write and maintain this website.

anyway, thanks for reading. i'll have more in store shortly.
