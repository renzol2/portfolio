## Lakas ng Pagsasama: Strength in Community

**Filipino Americans Coming Together** (FACT) is the largest student-led Filipino-Interest conference in the Midwest, attracting over 1,300 delegates annually from across the United States. FACT will be celebrating its 29th anniversary virtually on Whova and Youtube Premieres, opening the conference to those across the US. This year, the conference includes an opening ceremony, social justice workshops, cultural expression workshops, career panels, networking sessions, delegate discussions, and variety show.

The theme for this year’s conference is _“Lakas ng Pagsasama: Strength in Community.”_ Strength refers to the power each individual has to make change in their communities. Community refers to the inclusion and celebration of people from different cultural backgrounds and identities. Given the rise in anti-Asian hate and POC struggle because of the pandemic, we wish to support and uplift our communities for this year’s FACT Conference.

The Philippine Student Association at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign seeks to empower delegates, engage in meaningful dialogue, and stand in solidarity with other marginalized communities. By relying on the strength of our communities, we overcome adversity.
