## Mission

Pan-Lang is an organizational web application designed to help local food bank organizers keep track of orders, maintain visitor records, and communicate with non-English speaking patrons.

Food insecurity is an important issue in the Champaign County community. Nearly 15% of residents must deal with food insecurity. Many of these individuals are also ineligible for federal nutrition programs and must rely on local food pantries for meals.

On top of this, many of these individuals speak limited English, making it difficult for them to communicate their needs to food pantry staff. With Pan-Lang, our mission is to break this language barrier and provide a more efficient method of supporting those in need.
