I composed and produced the soundtrack alongside my colleague [Kevin Zhou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-zhou-b092091b7/) for the short film _Out of Time_ (2021), produced by 16feet Media.

**Synopsis**: A medieval knight named Percival Vain (Jeremy Poynton) is transported to modern-day USA. With no way home, he helps a young woman investigate the disappearance of her brother. Unraveling clues, the knight begins to suspect that he isn't the only one out of time.
