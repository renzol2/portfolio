# 'Kapit Bisig' | Together in Unity

### Co-Coordinator

Throughout the 2021-2022 academic year, I was a Filipino Culture Night (FCN) 2022 Co-Coordinator for the [Philippine Student Association UIUC](https://psauiuc.org/) alongside my co-chair Abbie Mondala. Our theme was _Kapit Bisig_, literally meaning 'holding hands together'.

At the end of the school year, I organized and produced a [zine/booklet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A1YwKbkzxPjnZ6AFhJskcXxnJhPhMT0z/view) with contributions from the PSA Community. This collaborative project is a small but powerful collection of art and poetry celebrating Filipino/Filipino-American culture, and I am greatly indebted to the artists & writers of PSA for their amazing work.
