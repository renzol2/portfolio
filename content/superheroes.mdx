# The State of Asian Superheroes in Comics

### Data-Driven Article | IS 390

During the Spring 2021 semester, I wrote an interactive data article titled ["The State of Asian Superheroes in Comics"](https://renzol2.github.io/is390) as a final project for [IS 390 RGS - Race, Gender, Sex in Comics](https://ischool.illinois.edu/degrees-programs/courses/is390), where I analyzed the representation of Asian superheroes in Marvel and DC comics. To put this together, I used a combination of [Python web scraping](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), React for putting together the web page, and [nivo](https://nivo.rocks/) for displaying the data interactively.

Special thanks to [Professor Carol Tilley](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/carol-tilley) for the guidance and support throughout that semester. The source code for this project is in my old portfolio website, found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/renzol2/renzol2.github.io/). I also have a small [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Jv7oxs1wlogUnCZnL0akRHztFJqwD0rs-CdTJnm34_I/edit?usp=sharing) as part of my final submission.

Note: the web page is a little buggy and isn't very good on mobile. I'll likely move it to this portfolio page directly once I have time!
