# The State of Asian Superheroes in Comics (IS 390)

during the spring 2021 semester, i wrote an interactive data article titled ["The State of Asian Superheroes in Comics"](https://renzol2.github.io/is390) as a final project for [IS 390 RGS - Race, Gender, Sex in Comics](https://ischool.illinois.edu/degrees-programs/courses/is390), where i analyzed the representation of Asian superheroes in Marvel and DC comics

one of my goals in this portfolio was to use MDX to port that article to this website, and take advantage of using React components within Markdown. that's a project for another day ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
