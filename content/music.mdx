# i have no idea what i'm doing. üê∏

Although I was classically trained as a pianist, I've been producing music for a few years now! I make lots of different types of music, and I'm still trying to figure out what exactly I want to do musically.

I've been better about uploading things rather than keeping them to myself, so you can listen to all my work over the past 5 years on my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/zenr0). I'll be uploading future, polished works on other streaming platforms!

Below are some playlists/compilations for convenience:

1. Multi-genre instrumental beats for **MUS 499 BT1 (_Art of Beatmaking I_)** Fall 2021 at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
2. Multi-genre instrumental beats for **MUS 499 BT2 (_Art of Beatmaking II_)** Spring 2022 at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
3. Electroacoustic pieces for **MUS 409 (_Electroacoustic Music Techniques II_)** Spring 2022 at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
4. _everyday_ EP, a collection of tracks each made in a day for 5 days from 8.9.2021 to 8.13.2021
5. Miscellaneous music projects/drafts
6. Instrumental tracks produced as part of the **Music Technology Center** of the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Student Productions (ISP) team
