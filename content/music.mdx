# i have no idea what i'm doing. üê∏

TL;DR: I am a **producer/composer/pianist** and I like making lots of music!

Although I was classically trained as a pianist, I've been producing music for a few years now. I make lots of different types of music, beginning with electronic/EDM in my early years of learning music technology and recently branching into hip-hop, film, and electroacoustic music while keeping my electronic & piano roots. I'm still trying to figure out what exactly I want to do musically, so come back here in a few months and see what's new!

I've been better about uploading things rather than keeping them to myself, so you can listen to all my work over the past 5 years on my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/zenr0). I'll be uploading future, polished works on other streaming platforms!

I also post a little bit on [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@zenr0) and my [music Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/renzzz.os/)! You can find more casual music content there üòé
