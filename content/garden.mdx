# Digital Garden

### Zettelkasten Notetaking System

## What is this? 

I'm trying to better retain and utilize the information I'm learning by maintaining a digital garden ðŸŒ¿. All my notes are public and viewable, and my goal is that people will be able to learn some of the things I've been able to learn over the past few years in my higher education for computer science and music.

## Where can I find it?

You can find it [here](https://renzo-garden.vercel.app/).

For my note-taking tool, I'm using [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/), an open-source alternative to Zettelkasten tools like Obsidian and Roam Research. It's a VSCode extension and uses Markdown as its primary document format, with additional extensions to enable linking between notes.
